# Touché Experiments

This repository contains experiments with implementing an Arduino-based 
[Touché sensor](http://www.ivanpoupyrev.com/project/touche), and the [ESP project](https://github.com/damellis/ESP).

The experiments include determining the type of gestures made when 
houseplants (a fern and an air plant) are touched:

Experiments were also conducted examining how Touché can be used to 
discriminate types of touches when interacting with water:
